# Market Size App
This is a R Web App written with Shiny to interactively display a company's market size in an easy to use dashboard.  

The dashboard is available at: https://katiesaund.shinyapps.io/market_size_app/  

User can estimate the market size of a product, company or industry and generate a plot showing the relative sizes of the total available market (TAM), serviceable available market (SAM), and serviceable obtainable market (SOM).    

This dashboard was created to streamline market sizing efforts I undertake as a member of the University of Michigan's [Wolverine Venture Fund](http://zli.umich.edu/wolverine-venture-fund).
